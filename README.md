# Deals SMS App:
Never miss a single deal again on your favorite brands again with this custom-built restful API! 

Rather than trying to find deals through third party extensions which directs you to either the lowest price regardless of a vendor's reputation or sometimes promoting unreliable coupon codes that may have already expired, try Deals App instead!
